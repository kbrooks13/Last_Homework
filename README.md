 This code should be able to create a 'Seq' object that accepts a DNA sequence (a string).
 The code allows the counting of kmers of a defined size and of size 'k'.
 Pandas is used to find all possible k and the associated number of observed and expected kmers
 Seaborne is used to make a graph of the proportion of ech kmr observed
 Linguistic complexity is the observed kmers/possible kmers
 A script to thoroughly test each function could be used. I could not do this part, 
 but I would have used Sublime to test different numbers ( a decimal, a negative number, maybe a 0 and 1000) to make
 sure this code worked for eveything. If it were applied to another file it should be able to work wihtout a problem.
 I do not know what it means when it says "use the main function to read in your sequence data and output results.
 I created a github repository but I am unsure if I added the coding file correctly. I uploaded the file and created this readme file
 This was a very very hard assignement and I was unable to complete all of the steps.
